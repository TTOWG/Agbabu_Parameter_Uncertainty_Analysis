 Ergodic and non-ergodic variogram uncertainty in Agbabu bitumen field porosity data
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/640/1/012120/pdf

This project assesses the uncertainty in the ergodic and non-ergodic variogram estimates of the
Agbabu field porosity data. Multiple samples required for ergodic and non-ergodic variogram estimates
were drawn from simulated realizations of the porosity random field. Variogram estimates were
obtained (using a recently-formulated lag-cluster technique and conventional technique) for each sample. 
The sampling distributions of these estimates were examined with histograms and Normal Q-Q plots.

The ultimate contribution of this project is the interpretation of the difference between
ergodic and non-ergodic uncertainty measures. The interpretation is in terms of an assessment of the adequacy (or
otherwise) of the well spacing and distribution in Agbabu field.
